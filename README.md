⚠️ Disclaimer

This README and the bash script were written with the help of ChatGPT. However, the code itself was created manually and not generated by AI.
🗂️ File Organizer

This Python script organizes files in a given directory by sorting them into categorized folders:

    docs/ → .pdf, .docx, .txt

    images/ → .jpg, .png, .jpeg

    scripts/ → .py, .sh, .c

    others/ → Any unrecognized file types

The script ignores itself during the organization process (even after being moved outside and re-run).
✅ Current Improvements

The following issues have been fixed compared to the previous version:

✔ Incorrect Self-Exclusion
The script now correctly ignores only the currently running script and does not skip unrelated files with the same name elsewhere.

✔ Overcomplicated Logic
The logic has been simplified by using a direct mapping of extensions to categories without building intermediate lists.

✔ Improved Output and Logging
The script now provides clear feedback during execution.

✔ No File Overwriting on Duplicate Names
If a file with the same name already exists in the target folder, the script will not overwrite it. Instead, the file is left in its original location, ensuring no data loss.
