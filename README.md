# 🗂️ File Organizer

This Python script organizes the files in a given directory by sorting them into categorized folders:

- `Documents/` → `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.txt`, etc.
- `Images/` → `.jpg`, `.png`, `.jpeg`, etc.
- `Scripts/` → `.py`, `.sh`, `.c`, etc.
- `Others/` → Any unrecognized file types

It also ignores the calling script during the organization process.

---

## ⚠️ Known Issues in This Version

- **Incorrect Self-Exclusion**  
  The script excludes any file with the same name as the calling script, even if it's in another directory. This means files elsewhere with the same name are skipped unintentionally.

- **Overcomplicated Logic**  
  Files are first grouped into a dictionary before being moved. This adds unnecessary complexity.  
  A simpler approach would be to organize files directly as they are scanned.

---

## ✅ To Do

- Fix the script exclusion logic to only ignore itself in the root directory.
- Simplify the logic by removing the intermediate dictionary.
- Improve output and logging.
