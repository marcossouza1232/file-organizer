⚠️ Disclaimer

This README and the bash script were written with the help of ChatGPT. However, the code itself was created manually and not generated by AI.
🗂️ File Organizer

This Python script organizes files in a given directory by sorting them into categorized folders:

    Documents/ → .pdf, .docx, .txt, etc.

    Images/ → .jpg, .png, .jpeg, etc.

    Scripts/ → .py, .sh, .c, etc.

    Others/ → Any unrecognized file types

It ignores the script itself during the organization process (even after being moved outside and re-run).
✅ Current Improvements

The following issues have been fixed compared to the previous version:

✔ Incorrect Self-Exclusion
The script now correctly ignores only the currently running script and does not skip unrelated files with the same name elsewhere.

✔ Overcomplicated Logic
The logic has been simplified by using a direct mapping of extensions to categories without building intermediate lists.

✔ Improved Output and Logging
The script now provides clear feedback during execution.
⚠️ New Known Issue

File Overwrite on Duplicate Names
If two or more files share the same name (even if they have different paths originally), moving them into the same category folder will overwrite the previous file without warning.
✅ To Do

    Implement a safe move mechanism (e.g., renaming duplicates instead of overwriting).

    Add a dry-run mode to preview changes before applying.

    Optionally support recursive directory organization.
